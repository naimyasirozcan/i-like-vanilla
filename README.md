# I LIKE VANILLA! 
> ## The Storybook of My CSS & BS5 & VanillaJS Learning Process..
This repository includes the resources provided to me via patika.dev while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the notes I took during the lessons and the practice projects I built based on them. It also contains the resulting website I created while experimenting with what I learned. Throughout this process, I made significant progress in using tools and technologies such as VS Code, Git, Git Bash, GitHub, GitHub CLI, Node, npm, and Bootstrap.
Once the site is complete, I will update this README file and provide a sitemap. For my next project, I plan to use React and Tailwind CSS!! Wish me luck :)
