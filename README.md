# I LIKE VANILLA! 
> ## class-lesson folder:
This folder includes the resources provided by patika.dev on my self-learning process. I created different js file for each lesson and took notes into these files. I created a test folder for test everything I've learned. Throughout this process, I made significant progress in using tools and technologies such as VS Code, Git, Git Bash, GitHub, GitHub CLI, Node, npm, and Bootstrap.

## i-like-vanilla folder:
This is the folder of my example website: nyoworks.
I thought a single page site that shows my beginner skills with various sections and mini applications would be good as my very first portfolio.
I created standart sections and mini applications in shape of single page website, also we have a mini toss game in it!

I've tried to use only my own knowledge, basic bootstrap layout and non-AI sources like MDN, W3, Stackoverflow etc. It was a hard but very efficient experience. I hope you enjoy, cheers.
